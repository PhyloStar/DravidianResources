# DravidianResources
A repository to share resources on Dravidian languages.

* Consists of cognate judgments for four Dravidian languages: Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, and Kannada. The data is in IPA and is derived from [North EuraLex] (http://www.northeuralex.org/languages). The cognate judgments are assigned semi-automatically by training an [online EM algorithm] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.04938.pdf) and then correcting the automatic judgments.
